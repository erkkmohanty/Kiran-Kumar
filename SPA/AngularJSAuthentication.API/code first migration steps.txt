1.enable-migrations    (for enabling the migrations)
2.add-migration InitialCreate

The enable-migrations command creates a Migrations folder in the ContosoUniversity project, and it puts in that folder a Configuration.cs file that you can edit to configure Migrations.

(If you missed the step above that directs you to change the database name, Migrations will find the existing database and automatically do the add-migration command. That's OK, it just means you won't run a test of the migrations code before you deploy the database. Later when you run the update-database command nothing will happen because the database will already exist.)

3.update-database
